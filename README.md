# Mod of https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/update365
Side note if you are from sir theretard0:
- There was a bug in the code which was fixed ( https://github.com/SKGleba/update365/commit/32ac62e6bc7718014779eea157f63c8efcd11039 ), there was one beta that was broken (old version), the OSFs were clean.
- If someone TESTS a beta, it is NORMAL that there are bugs, (thats what a beta release is for- to hunt bugs), so HE KNOWS that something may go wrong, and I AM NOT responsible for the damage it did. 
- ONE of beta testers (the one who tested the old build) ended up with stock 3.65 .
# Also i have a small bonus info about theretard0's hipocrisy:
In first versions of updater365 he made a mistake in the code and a beta tester ended up with stock fw, sounds familiar? .
