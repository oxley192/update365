Mod of https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/update365 (copied from henkaku/enso mod)
Changes made to source: 
- Added possibility to load config from ux0 if in safemode/updatemode (if it doesnt exist it just skips to real psp2config so its fully safe and you can recover from full vs0 delete).
- Removed enso logo hook
- Added ineedsettings to henkaku ( https://github.com/SKGleba/ineedsettings )
- Added DEX/TEST spoof to enso payload (since Project DeepLoad wasnt released yet its only in #releases, not open src).
# Side note if you are from sir theflow0:
- There was a bug in the code which was fixed ( https://github.com/SKGleba/update365/commit/32ac62e6bc7718014779eea157f63c8efcd11039 ), there was one beta that was broken (old version), the OSFs were clean.
- If someone TESTS a beta, it is NORMAL that there are bugs, (thats what a beta release is for- to hunt bugs), so HE KNOWS that something may go wrong, and I AM NOT responsible for the damage it did. 
- ONE of beta testers (the one who tested the old build) ended up with stock 3.65 .
# Also i have a small info::
In first versions of updater365 he made a mistake in the code and beta tester ended up with stock fw, sounds familiar?
